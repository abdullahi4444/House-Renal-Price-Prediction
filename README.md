# 🏡 House Rental Price Prediction  
A complete end-to-end Machine Learning project for predicting house rental prices using Python, Scikit-Learn, and Streamlit.  
This project demonstrates real-world ML workflow: data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, serialization, and UI deployment.

---

## 🚀 Overview
This system predicts the rental price of a house based on features such as:
- Location  
- House size  
- Number of rooms  
- Other numerical/categorical attributes  

The model is trained using a preprocessing + Random Forest pipeline, then deployed through a Streamlit interface.

---

## 🔧 Features
- End-to-end ML pipeline using **ColumnTransformer**
- Categorical encoding via **OneHotEncoder**
- **RandomForestRegressor** model
- Model saved & loaded with **Joblib**
- **Streamlit** web UI for live predictions
- Clean, modular project architecture

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **Joblib**
- **Streamlit**
- **GitHub**

## ⚙️ ML Pipeline Architecture
1. Load & clean dataset  
2. Preprocess:
   - One-hot encoding (categorical)
   - Pass-through (numerical)
3. Train model using Random Forest  
4. Serialize model with Joblib  
5. Build Streamlit interface for runtime predictions
